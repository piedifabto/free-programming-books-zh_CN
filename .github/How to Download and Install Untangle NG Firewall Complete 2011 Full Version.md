## Step 1: Download the Software
 
The first step is to download the software from the official website of Untangle. You can find the download link here: [https://www.untangle.com/get-untangle/](https://www.untangle.com/get-untangle/). You will need to fill out a form with some basic information, such as your name, email address, and organization name. After that, you will receive an email with a link to download the software.
 
The software is available in two formats: ISO and IMG. The ISO format is for installing the software on a dedicated server or a virtual machine. The IMG format is for installing the software on a USB flash drive or an SD card. Choose the format that suits your needs and download it to your computer.
 
## Step 2: Install the Software
 
The next step is to install the software on your system. Depending on the format you chose, you will need to follow different steps.
 
### ISO Format
 
If you downloaded the ISO format, you will need to burn it to a CD or DVD, or mount it as a virtual drive. Then, you will need to boot your system from the CD/DVD or the virtual drive, and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to choose a language, accept the license agreement, configure your network settings, and set a password for the admin account.
 
After that, the installation will begin and it will take some time to complete. Once it is done, you will need to reboot your system and remove the CD/DVD or unmount the virtual drive. You will then be able to access the web interface of Untangle NG Firewall Complete by typing https://192.168.2.1 in your browser.
 
### IMG Format
 
If you downloaded the IMG format, you will need to write it to a USB flash drive or an SD card using a tool such as Rufus or Etcher. Then, you will need to plug the USB flash drive or the SD card into your system and boot from it. You will see a menu with two options: Install Untangle NG Firewall or Run Untangle NG Firewall Live.
 
If you choose Install Untangle NG Firewall, you will follow the same steps as described above for the ISO format. If you choose Run Untangle NG Firewall Live, you will be able to run the software without installing it on your system. However, this option is not recommended for production use, as any changes you make will not be saved.
