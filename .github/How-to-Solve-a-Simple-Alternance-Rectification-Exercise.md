# How to Solve a Simple Alternance Rectification Exercise
 
A simple alternance rectification exercise is a problem that involves converting an alternating current (AC) input into a direct current (DC) output by suppressing one of the alternances (usually the negative one) and keeping the other one (usually the positive one). This can be done using a diode, which is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow only in one direction. In this article, we will show how to solve a simple alternance rectification exercise using an example from a PDF file called "Exercise Corrige Redressement Simple Alternance 40.pdf".

## Step 1: Identify the input and output parameters
 
The first step is to identify the input and output parameters of the rectification exercise. These include the amplitude, frequency, phase, and waveform of the AC input, and the average and peak values of the DC output. The PDF file provides these parameters as follows:
 
- The AC input has an amplitude of 220 V, a frequency of 50 Hz, a phase of 0Â°, and a sinusoidal waveform.
- The DC output has an average value of 70.7 V and a peak value of 220 V.

## Step 2: Draw the circuit diagram
 
The second step is to draw the circuit diagram of the simple alternance rectification exercise. The circuit consists of a diode connected in series with a resistor and an AC voltage source. The diode is oriented such that it blocks the negative alternances and allows the positive alternances to pass through. The resistor represents the load of the circuit. The PDF file gives the value of the resistor as 100 Î©. The circuit diagram is shown below:

## Step 3: Calculate the output voltage
 
The third step is to calculate the output voltage of the simple alternance rectification exercise. The output voltage is equal to the input voltage multiplied by the diode conduction factor, which is the fraction of time that the diode is conducting. The diode conduction factor depends on the input frequency, phase, and waveform. For a sinusoidal input with a phase of 0Â°, the diode conduction factor can be calculated as follows:
 
*f<sub>d</sub> = 1 - cos(Ïf<sub>i</sub>/f<sub>o</sub>)*
 
where *f<sub>d</sub>* is the diode conduction factor, *f<sub>i</sub>* is the input frequency, and *f<sub>o</sub>* is the output frequency. Since the output frequency is equal to the input frequency for a simple alternance rectification exercise, we can simplify this formula as follows:
 
*f<sub>d</sub> = 1 - cos(Ï)*
 
Substituting Ï = 3.14, we get:
 
*f<sub>d</sub> = 1 - cos(3.14)*
 
*f<sub>d</sub> = 1 - (-1)*
 
*f<sub>d</sub> = 2*
 
Therefore, the diode conduction factor is 2. This means that the diode conducts for half of each cycle of the AC input. To calculate the output voltage, we multiply the input voltage by 2:
 
*V<sub>o</sub> = f<sub>d</sub>V<sub>i</sub>*
 
*V<sub>o</sub> = 2V<sub>i</sub>*
 
Substituting V<sub>i</sub> = 220 V, we get:
 
*V<sub>o</sub> = 2(220)*
 
*V<sub>o</sub> = 440 V*
