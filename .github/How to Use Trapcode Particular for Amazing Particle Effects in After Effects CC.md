In this article, we will explain what Trapcode Particular is, how it works, and why you should avoid cracking it. We will also show you some examples of what you can do with it and how to get started with it.
  
## What is Trapcode Particular?
 
Trapcode Particular is a plugin for After Effects that lets you create and control particle systems. A particle system is a collection of small elements that move and interact according to certain rules. You can use particle systems to simulate natural phenomena like fire, smoke, water, dust, sparks, etc.
 
Trapcode Particular gives you a lot of control over the appearance and behavior of your particles. You can adjust their size, shape, color, opacity, rotation, velocity, gravity, turbulence, and more. You can also use 3D objects as emitters or deflectors for your particles. For example, you can make particles emit from a text layer or bounce off a solid layer.
 
Trapcode Particular also integrates with After Effects' 3D camera and lights. This means you can move your camera around your particle system and see it from different angles. You can also use lights to illuminate your particles and create shadows and reflections.
 
Trapcode Particular has a built-in designer that lets you preview your particle system in real time. You can also use presets to quickly apply different styles and effects to your particles.
  
## How to Use Trapcode Particular in After Effects CC
 
To use Trapcode Particular in After Effects CC, you need to install the plugin first. You can download it from the official website of Red Giant[^2^], the company that develops it. You can also get a free trial version that lasts for 14 days.
 
Once you have installed the plugin, you can apply it to any layer in your composition. To do that, go to Effect > Red Giant > Trapcode Particular. This will open the Effect Controls panel where you can adjust the settings of your particle system.
 
You can also open the designer by clicking on the Designer button at the top of the panel. The designer will show you a preview of your particle system and let you change its parameters using sliders and menus.
 
To create a basic particle system, you need to set up three main components: emitter, particles, and physics. The emitter is the source of your particles. You can choose from different types of emitters like point, box, sphere, grid, layer, etc. The particles are the elements that make up your system. You can choose from different shapes like sphere, cloudlet, star, glow sphere, etc. The physics are the forces that affect your particles like gravity, air resistance, wind, turbulence, etc.
 
You can also add other components like aux system (secondary particles), shading (lighting and shadows), visibility (fading and depth of field), etc.
 
To animate your particle system, you can keyframe any of the parameters or use expressions. You can also use After Effects' built-in tools like masks
